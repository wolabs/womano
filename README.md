# WoMANO
    
    WoMANO is an open source project that provides a practical 

realization of the Network Function Virtualization Management and 

Orchestration(NFV MANO)from the perspective of Telecommunication 

Operator. The building of WoMANO conforms to the ETSI's NFV ISG 

standardization. WoMANO focuses on network service orchestration

(NFVO) and virtual resource management(NFVI+VIM), and integrates 

the open source cloud computing platform OpenStack native interface 

successfully, and also integrates the open source capability 

component(including Ceph,Opendaylight,KVM) and VNF

systems(OpenEPC, ClearWater). It implements the orchestration, 

deployment, reliability and elastic extension of VoLTE network 

services, it successfully explores operation mode of 

network services under the environment of NFV and verifies the 

technical feasibility of virtual network function (VNF) carried on 

the cloud computing platform. It provides the reference for China 

Unicom to carry out network infrastructure upgrades, and simplified 

network operating mode.

    WoMANO provides three software modules:

1. Womanoï¼šit realizes the network service orchestration (NFV-O), 

it can create a complex virtual network environment. It interfaces 

with the virtual infrastructure manager (VIM) and provids the 

upstream interface for providing NFV services, such as creating or 

deleting virtual network functions.

2.WoVIM: it relizes virtual resource management, it interfaces with 

the computing nodes and controller, provids compute and network 

capabilities, and the deployment of virtual machines. It externally 

offers the upstream interfaces, you can enhance the function of the 

cloud computing services, such as creating, deleting, managing the 

images, instances and network.
