# WoMANO
  WoMANO is an open source project that provides a practical realization of the Network Function Virtualization Management and Orchestration(NFV MANO)from the perspective of Telecommunication Operator. The building of WoMANO conforms to the ETSI's NFV ISG standardization. WoMANO focuses on network service orchestration(NFVO) and virtual resource anagement(NFVI+VIM), and integrates the open source cloud computing platform OpenStack native interface successfully, and also integrates the open source capability component(including Ceph,Opendaylight,KVM) and VNF systems(OpenEPC, ClearWater). It implements the orchestration, deployment, reliability and elastic extension of VoLTE network services, it successfully explores operation mode of network services under the environment of NFV and verifies the technical feasibility of virtual network function (VNF) carried on the cloud computing platform. It provides the reference for China Unicom to carry out network infrastructure upgrades, and simplified network operating mode.
